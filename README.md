The Odin Project: Foundations Course.
Landing Page.  

For this project I’ll be creating an entire web page from a design The Odin Project have provide.
They’re providing me with 2 images: one is an image of the complete website and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors they’ve used.

I need to get my project as close as I can to the design but not to worry about getting it pixel-perfect.
The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

Finally, I am free to substitute my own content into this design. 

Here I go...
